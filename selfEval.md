# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    I am most proud that I was able to incoorporate a variable into my function, and I'm proud that I did my due dilligence to understand parameters/arguements. I consumed a lot of additonal material to make sure that I could distinguish the two. 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    functions allow us to solve unique problems, ones that go beyond the scope of the built in methods. This solution-based process will help our programs be versatile, resusable, and clear.
